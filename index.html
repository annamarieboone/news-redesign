			<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>NDIANAPOLIS - The kids felt it first. The day the governor declared refugees like them unwelcome, fear pulsed through their schools. </p>

<p>Rama, the 15-year-old, heard it in her classmates&rsquo; voices when they blamed Muslims, saw it when they pointed at her headscarf. Rakan, her 13-year-old brother, was caught off guard when a group of boys approached him in the hallway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you in ISIS?&rdquo; they asked him. He shook his head and slinked away. </p>

<p>Like the rest of their family, the two teenagers knew about the terror in Paris the previous Friday, the bombings and gunfire that left more than 100 people dead. They knew that ISIS had claimed responsibility for the attacks and that a fake Syrian passport had been left at the scene. But news of Gov. Mike Pence&rsquo;s announcement the following Monday hadn&rsquo;t reached them. </p>

<p>When the Batman family heard that Pence was blocking Syrian refugees from entering Indiana, their small apartment fell silent. </p>

<p>Ten seconds passed. Fifteen, then twenty. Marwan, the father, was the first to speak. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Call?&rdquo; he asked in his broken English, holding up a cell phone. &ldquo;Call?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marwan didn&rsquo;t know the governor&rsquo;s name and didn't understand that getting him on the phone would be almost impossible. Over the rims of his glasses, he looked over at his wife, at Rama and Rakan, at his two youngest daughters chasing each other up and down the staircase.</p>

<p>If Marwan could just talk to the governor, maybe he could tell him his family's story. Maybe he could help the man understand.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Batman family is among a handful of Syrian families who have fled the civil war in their country and settled in Indiana, joining about two thousand Syrian refugees living across the United States. Since the terrorist attacks in Paris, they have been swept up in a national wave of paranoia and hatred directed against Muslims.</p>

<p>In Chicago, two men were prevented from boarding a plane after they were overheard speaking Arabic. Human feces and pages ripped from a Koran were thrown at the door of a Texas mosque. A few hours drive from that mosque, protestors outside an Islamic center carried picket signs and 12-gauge shotguns.</p>

<p>An Indianapolis volunteer told the city&rsquo;s small community of Syrians to stay in their homes. &ldquo;People are angry,&rdquo; she texted them. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen.&rdquo;  Citing concerns of terrorism, more than half the country&rsquo;s governors announced plans to oppose or block Syrian refugees from settling in their states. Pence was one of the first. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Indiana has a long tradition of opening our arms and homes to refugees from around the world,&quot; Pence said in a statement. &quot;But as governor, my first responsibility is to ensure the safety and security of all Hoosiers.&rdquo; </p>

<p>When Pence made his announcement, a new family of Syrian refugees was scheduled to fly into Indianapolis the next day. They never made it. The couple and their small child were rerouted to Connecticut, where the governor publicly welcomed them to the state and mocked Pence&rsquo;s decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the same guy who signed a homophobic bill in the spring, surrounded by homophobes,&rdquo; Gov. Dannel Malloy said. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m not surprised by anything the governor does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As masses of Syrians huddled outside European borders and in cramped refugee camps in Turkey and Iran, they became the central figures in a debate over the soul of America. Would a nation founded by refugees now turn them away?</p>

<p>Politicians labeled them as terrorists-in-wait, saying the United States&rsquo; intensive screening process couldn&rsquo;t catch everything. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Highly concerning,&rdquo; said Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is clear that the influx of Syrian refugees poses a threat,&rdquo; said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do everything humanly possible to stop any plans&#8230; to put Syrian refugees in Mississippi,&rdquo; said Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant.</p>

<p>Donald Trump suggested the refugees could be a &ldquo;Trojan horse&rdquo; for terrorism, and promised to send them back if he is elected. Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz offered plans to accept only Christian refugees. </p>

<p>President Obama condemned the blockade, calling it &ldquo;shameful&rdquo; and &ldquo;not American.&rdquo; He declared the United States would continue to accept refugees. </p>

<p>As America argued, the flood of people rushing out of Syria continued. More than nine million Syrians have been forced out of their homes in the last five years as casualties of an ever-escalating civil war. Of those, more than 4 million have fled the country.</p>

<p>This summer, President Obama pledged to take in at least 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year. The country has made little progress on that plan before it became America&rsquo;s most hotly debated policy. </p>

<p>The United Nations has recommended more than 22,000 Syrian refugees for resettlement in the United States since 2013. After a screening process that can take as long as two years, about 2,000 have been accepted. </p>

<p>The Batmans were among the first Syrian refugees to settle in Indiana. Together, they are navigating a world they can&rsquo;t understand: learning English, starting school and paying bills while the country decides what to do with them. </p>

<p>When they arrived, everything was new. Rakan knew his last name &ndash; Batman, like the superhero &ndash; was popular in America, but not much else. </p>

<p>A year later, the family&rsquo;s future is laid out in a series of milestones: apply for green cards in November, college for Rama and Rakan, citizenship in five years, get the rest of their family out of Syria. Go back only after the war. </p>

<p>After the country&rsquo;s leaders turned their back on refugees like them, they felt their future here slipping away. </p>

			<h3>Media Categories</h3>
			<p>There are two categories your media falls into. Figure media requires a figure tag around it and a figcaption to explain what it is. HTML media doesn't require a figure tag although it can be place in one if you want. HTML media is place in custom divs you or I have made. In general, html content scales size easier, but figure content is quicker to setup.</p>

			<h4>Figure media includes</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>images</li>
				<li>videos</li>
				<li>audio</li>
				<li>embedded content</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>HTML media includes</h4>
			<ul>

			<a name="placement"></a>
			<h3>Media Placement</h3>
				<p>The grid of this article on a medium or larger screen is one body-copy column that is 7 columns wide with one column offset to the left, and one sidebar column that is 4 columns wide. For mobile, everything is the full 12 colunmns wide. These columns live in a row which can be used to organize sections of your code. You can copy in as many columns into a row as you want, but once the total width of the columns equals 12, any other columns will float underneath. Since everything floats to the top, the easiest way to lineup the sidebar with the body-copy is to start a body-copy column on the paragraph that you want to line up the sidebar with. Then include the sidebar underneath and the sidebar will float and line up with the top of the first paragraph or first media in the body-copy column. If you want to read more about the grid structure, read about <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html">Bootstrap scaffolding</a>.</p>
		
				<p>Any media can be placed in one of three areas - inline, sidebar on break. Inline is in the body copy column, sidebar is obviously in the sidebar and break breaks from the row and gives you access to make something the full screen width. You can technically add more options by making divs in the columns a different percentage width (width: 50%, 150%, etc.) if you need a work around. Try to avoid doing this if you can, but often when making graphics something doesn't line up quite right and you need a little more freedom. Stay away from absolute values (width: 50px) as they are more buggy when coding a responsive design unless something is small like styling the twitter button to width: 5px, since this doesn't need to change when loaded on a mobile device.</p>

				<p>If you want to animate your media, look at <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">animate.css</a> and <a href="http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/">wow.js</a> to reveal those animations when scrolled over. Look at my story about <a href="specials.idsnews.com/yaolin">Yaolin Wang's murder</a> or <a href="https://github.com/IU-Student-Media/specials/tree/master/yaolin">check out the code</a> to see a working example of both.</p>
